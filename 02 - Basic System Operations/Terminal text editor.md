1. **Opening and Creating Files**:
   - To open an existing file or create a new one, type:
     ```
     nano filename
     ```
   - Replace `filename` with the actual name of the file you want to edit. Nano will open the file in a new editor window.

2. **Basic Editing**:
   - Nano is modeless, meaning you can start typing and editing immediately.
   - To move the cursor to a specific line and character number, use `Ctrl+_`. Enter the line and column numbers when prompted.
   - To save your changes and exit, press `Ctrl+x`.

3. **Searching and Replacing**:
   - To search for text, press `Ctrl+w`, type your search term, and press `Enter`.
   - To move to the next match, press `Alt+w`.
   - For search and replace, press `Ctrl+\`. Enter the search term and the replacement text.
