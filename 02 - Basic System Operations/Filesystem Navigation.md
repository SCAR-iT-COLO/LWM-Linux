1. **Print Working Directory (pwd):** Use `pwd` to display your current location in the filesystem. It shows the absolute path from the root directory (e.g., `/home/user`). Absolute paths are crucial for scripts.

2. **Change Directory (cd):**
    - To move up one level (e.g., from `/home/user/docs` to `/home/user`), use `cd ..`.
    - To go directly to a specific directory (e.g., `/home/user/music`), provide the absolute path: `cd /home/user/music`.
    - To return home from any location, use `cd ~`.
