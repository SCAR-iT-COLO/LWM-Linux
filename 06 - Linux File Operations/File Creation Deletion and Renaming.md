## Certainly! Let's explore file management tasks in **Linux Mint**. Here are some essential commands:

1. **Creating a File**:
   - To create a new file, use the `touch` command followed by the desired filename:
     ```
     touch sample.txt
     ```

2. **Copying Files**:
   - The `cp` command copies a file. For example:
     ```
     cp file.txt new-file.txt
     ```

3. **Moving or Renaming Files**:
   - The `mv` command moves files from one location to another. It's also used for renaming files:
     ```
     mv old-file.txt new-file.txt
     ```

4. **Removing Files**:
   - To delete a file, use the `rm` command:
     ```
     rm unwanted-file.txt
     ```

Remember, these commands empower you to manage files efficiently! Feel free to ask if you need further assistance. 😊🚀
