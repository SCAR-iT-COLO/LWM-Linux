# Installing Linux Mint

## **Step 1: Download Linux Mint**
- Go to the official Linux [Mint website](https://www.linuxmint.com/download.php) and download the latest version of Linux Mint for your system.
- If you bought your PC in the past decade - use 64-bit!
- Cinnamon is recommended for new users.
- The download will be an ISO file, which is an image of the Linux Mint operating system.

## **Step 2: Create a Bootable USB or DVD**
- You'll need to create a bootable USB drive or DVD to install Linux Mint. There are several tools you can use for this, such as Balena Etcher, Rufus, or the built-in tool in Windows 10/11.
- Insert a blank USB drive or DVD, and use your preferred tool to write the Linux Mint ISO file to the media.

## **Step 3: Boot from the Bootable Media**
- Insert the bootable USB drive or DVD into your computer.
- Restart your computer and enter the boot menu. This is usually done by pressing a specific key during the boot process, such as F2, F12, or Del, depending on your computer's manufacturer.
- Select the option to boot from the USB drive or DVD.

## **Step 4: Start the Installation**
- Once your computer boots from the bootable media, you'll see the Linux Mint live environment.
- Click on the "Install Linux Mint" icon on the desktop to begin the installation process.

  - **Something else**: This option allows you to manually partition your hard drive and customize the installation.

## **Step 6: Configure Your Installation**
- Choose your preferred language, time zone, and keyboard layout.
- Create a username and password for your user account.

## **Step 7: Install Linux Mint**

- The installation may take several minutes, depending on the speed of your computer and the selected installation options.

## **Step 8: Finish the Installation**
